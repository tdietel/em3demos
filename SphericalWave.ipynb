The dependence on only the distance, and not individual coordinates $x,y,z$ shows that we are dealing with an isotropic behaviour, i.e. we expect the same potential in every direction. The attenuation factor $1/r$ will reduce the amplitude for a large distances. In the end, this factor ensures that the energy passing through a sphere with radius $r$ will be independent of $r$."
