# Jupyter Demonstrations for Electromagnetism

This repository contains (or will contain) Jupyter notebooks to visualize some
concepts covered my electromagnetism section of the third year physics course at
the University of Cape Town.

These notebooks are a first shot, and can certainly be improved. You are welcome
to fork the repository, play with the notebooks and modify them. Please create a
pull request if you have something worth sharing.

## Usage

These instructions are minimal: clone the git repository and start [Jupyter
Notebook] in your working directory.

You can also launch the notebooks directly on the [MyBinder] service: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tdietel/em3demos/master)
